# Auth App (Angular + ASP .NET Core)

simple app with login, showcasing hashing as well as
cookie and JWT auth (depending on which one you have already selected)
Once logged in, you can see your username,email and password to verify 
that this is working 100%.

For context, the cookie's value that you get is the JWT token, this project is a demonstration of 2 different auth methods. One of them being used for login (JWT specifically)
which uses the [Authorize] attribute.
